#You've Been Glitched#

The caverns of shadow land have been infected by the Glitch, an alien virus that affects the very fabric of space time itself. The world around you distorts as it grows at a frightening rate through the caverns, pulsing with an energy that warps gravity. Only you have the power to restore stability to the affected areas, but do it fast! ...as if it is given too much time to grow, it will be unstoppable in its advance.

This is an an entry for [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) 2016. The theme for this year was "Glitch".

#Compatibility Notes#
The game was developed using Chrome 50 on Linux, on which the rotation runs smoothly at full speed and everything works perfectly. So for Linux users, I would recommend Chrome, although it also works fine on Firefox on Linux.

For Windows, I would recommend Firefox. This is due to Chrome appearing to have a performance issue with canvas rotation that neither Firefox nor Internet Explorer suffer from on Windows. Everything works perfectly on Firefox under Windows, and I'd also suggest giving it a go in Internet Explorer 10 or above. The graphics were surprisingly smooth there as well, perhaps even better than Firefox, although the sound appears not to work in Internet Explorer.

It might require a reasonably fast computer with a semi-decent graphics card as well, regardless of the OS.
