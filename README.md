#You've Been Glitched#

The caverns of shadow land have been infected by the Glitch, an alien virus that affects the very fabric of space time itself. The world around you distorts as it grows at a frightening rate through the caverns, pulsing with an energy that warps gravity. Only you have the power to restore stability to the affected areas, but do it fast! ...as if it is given too much time to grow, it will be unstoppable in its advance.

This is an an entry for [js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) 2016. The theme for this year was "Glitch".

#Notes#
Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Might require a reasonably fast computer, with a semi-decent graphics card, although it has been working fine in a VirtualBox VM. I've noticed that Chrome running on my laptop really struggled with the rotation, but Firefox and Internet Explorer on the same device worked perfectly. So my advice would be to check the graphics acceleration settings in Chrome if there are performance issues there.
